### What is this about? (Introduction)

An sophisticated website project for an ecommerce platform. This website was developed using Python, and some of its popular libraries 
including the Django Framework. Other front-end technologies were also used to achieve the sleek styling and designs of the main sites,
 some include: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JQuery.

### Source of Inspiration

After delving deeply into the Django Framework and gaining a broader understanding of its inner workings, I became especially captivated by its simplicity and coordination
 with third party packages. I decided to integrate some of these and test out some of its highly robust features. I.e -> User authentication system, Django's built-in
 template language, notebook compatibility, security features, etc. 

Though I do not have a solid foundation on UX design and styling, as my main focus resides in the backend technologies, I strived to make this project elegant and appealing to the eye. I am quite delighted with the outcome, and much of this was accomplished thanks to the use of Bootstrap, their framework provides you with a variety of stylized components ready for integration with only a few lines of code which connects to their presets through their CDN. They also have great documentation, it was great help, as it drastically sped up the development time and was also useful fixing bugs along the way.
